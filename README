ActivityStream
==============

A dead easy way to log activity streams.

Installation
============

 script/plugin install http://github.com/evilmarty/activity_stream

Then run...

 script/generate activity_stream
 
this will create the Activity model and place it in your app/models path as a migration file.


DON'T FORGET to add :activity_observer to your config.active_record.observers in environments.rb like so...

 config.active_record.observers = :activity_observer

Usage
=====

For all the models you want to log an activity for do the following...

 class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
   log_activities
 end
 
this will log an activity for :create, :update and :destroy. To only log an activity for :create simply say so...

 class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
   log_activities :create
 end
 
You can also pass a Proc which can be used to check whether to log the activity or not, just return false

 class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
   log_activities :create, :destroy
   log_activities :update do |record|
     record.status == 1
   end
 end
 
and you can call it multiple times for different actions with different Procs


Now once your done with your logging, it's time to define your actors. Like so...

 class User < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_actor
 end
 
and now when you want to log activities simply do the following in your controllers or wherever you please

 class CommentsController < ApplicationController
   def create
     current_user.log_activity('web') do
       Comment.create params[:comment]
     end
   end
 end
 
that little argument for log_activity is the context of the activity but you can omit it should you feel so.

TODO
====

* write better doc
* add support for indirect objects maybe?
